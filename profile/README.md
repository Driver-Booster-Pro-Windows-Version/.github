## What is Driver Booster Pro?
Driver Booster Pro is a software program designed to automatically scan your system for outdated, missing, or faulty drivers and then download and install the latest versions. It boasts a vast driver database, supporting a wide range of hardware components, including graphics cards, sound cards, network adapters, printers, and more. The "Pro" version builds upon the free version with enhanced features and capabilities.

## Core Functionality: 
- **Driver Scanning**: Driver Booster Pro scans your Windows system to identify outdated, missing, or faulty drivers for various hardware components like graphics cards, audio devices, network adapters, printers, and more.
- **One-Click Update**: With a single click, it can automatically download and install the latest and best-matched drivers found in its extensive online database (containing over 15,000,000 drivers according to IObit).
- **Silent Background Updates**: The Pro version can automatically download and install driver updates in the background when your system is idle, without interrupting your work.
- **Driver Backup and Restore**: Before installing new drivers, Driver Booster Pro automatically backs up the existing drivers and creates a system restore point. This allows you to easily revert to previous driver versions if any issues arise after an update.
- **Enhanced Game Performance**: It can identify and update game-ready drivers and necessary game components (like DirectX, PhysX, etc.) to optimize your system for smoother gaming experiences and potentially fix bugs. It also has a "Game Boost" feature that can temporarily shut down background processes and unnecessary Windows services to free up system resources for gaming.
- **Fix Common Issues**: Driver Booster Pro includes tools to help fix common PC problems caused by driver issues, such as network failures, sound problems, incorrect resolutions, and device errors.
## System Requirements::
1. **Operating System**: Windows 11, 10, 8/8.1, 7, Vista, XP (both 32-bit and 64-bit versions are usually supported).
2. **Processor**: 1 GHz or faster.
3. **RAM**: 512 MB or more.
4. **Disk Space**: The software itself takes up a relatively small amount of space (around 25-30 MB for the application). However, you'll need additional free disk space (at least 1 GB is often recommended) for downloading and installing driver updates.
5. **Screen Resolution**: 1024x768 or above.
6. **Internet Connection**: Required for downloading driver updates.
## Conclusion:
 No hunting through shady manufacturer websites. And this version finally made the update engine faster and less prone to misfires.
